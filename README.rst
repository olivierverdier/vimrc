Vim configuration file
======================

Why should you bother using this configuration file?

Mac OS X friendly
*****************

I recently converted to vim from Textmate and other Mac OS X editors.
I tried to configure vim as conveniently as it could be for a Mac user.

Well documented
*********************************

It is also well documented, should you need to change the settings.
Hopefully you will not have to dive in the docs to understand those settings.
